Module 9 Challenge

This repository contains an SQL file that creates six tables based on the csv files provided in the Module resources. These SQL files are used to create an ERD Connection and visualization (which is also attached) as well as answering several data anaylsis questions that were asked in the Module guidelines. These analyses can be found in the Module 9 Analysis SQL file. I used information that I learned while in class, as well as the XPert Learning Assistant provided on Bootcamp Spot to help complete this assignment. I also used https://app.quickdatabasediagrams.com/#/ to help create the code used to create the tables in the Module 9 SQL file.
